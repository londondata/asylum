Welcome to asylum, your social sanctuary. asylum is a community of free expression built from the ashes of Melodramatic.com.
This website is dedicated to four individuals who have touched my life and inspired my work:
Sara Sioux, my mentor and the creator of Melodramatic.com,
Nicolas Sveen, my fallen Prince,
Josh Tilton, who is a pickle, and
Justin Castilla, the person who believed in me when I needed it the most.
